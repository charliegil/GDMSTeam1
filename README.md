## Rules

- **Creating a New Feature**  
  - Start by creating a branch from `dev`.  
  - Create a new scene inside your branch to develop your feature.  
  - Choose a clear and descriptive name for your branch and scene.  

- **Feature Completion**  
  - Once your feature is complete, create a pull request to `dev`.  
  - The pull request will be reviewed before merging.  

- **Testing and Merging**  
  - All features will be tested together before merging into `main`.  
  - The `main` branch will represent the current working build of the game.  

- **Access Control**  
  - Only specific individuals will be allowed to push to `main`. I haven't set this up yet, so anyone can push to main.
  - Please avoid pushing to main for the moment.

- **File Structure**
  - Please follow this file structure within your branch to simplify merging. If you think the current file structure isn't optimal, let me (Charlie) know and we can modify it.
  - Art
  - Code
    - Scripts
